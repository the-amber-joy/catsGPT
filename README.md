# catsGPT
I had a little conversation with ChatGPT and asked it to make this, step by step. Each commit is after I requested a change. The end result is not great, but it works. I did make a couple tweaks afterwards so root `/` would serve what had been at the `/cats` endpoint, and then I added a `"start"` script so it could run on Glitch.
